# Webpack-make
By TEAM TOES

###### This project was inspired by Webpack-Config-Generator: https://github.com/Webpack-Config-Generator/Webpack-Config-Generator

#### Wmake allows you to create and write a webpack configuration in your project directory, and to automatically install the npm dependencies that you have added in your configuration. 

#### For example, if you would like to use Babel, `wmake` will add the correct object to your webpack-config and can install babel-loader in your project directory. 

#### Run from your project directoryâ€”this is where your webpackconfig will be saved. 

#### To run without typing `npm run wmake` every time, run the following:
```
#### npm i wmake
#### npm deploy
#### wmake [-help, -v]
```
