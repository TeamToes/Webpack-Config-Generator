# Webpack-make
By TEAM TOES

###### This project was inspired by Webpack-Config-Generator: https://github.com/Webpack-Config-Generator/Webpack-Config-Generator

#### Wmake allows you to create and write a webpack configuration in your project directory, and to automatically install the npm dependencies that you have added in your configuration. 

#### For example, if you would like to use Babel, `wmake` will add the correct object to your webpack-config and can install babel-loader in your project directory. 

#### Run from your project directoryâ€”this is where your webpackconfig will be saved. 

#### To symlink locally:
```
npm init
npm i webpack-make --save
npm link ./node_modules/webpack-make
```
#### To run Webpack-make (wmake)
```
wmake
npm i
npx webpack
```
#### To symlink globally
```
npm init
npm i webpack-make --save -g
wmake
```
#### To unlink
```
npm uninstall webpack-make -g
```
